# More resources

In the worked examples in this chapter I have introduced a key set of plotting tools and highlighted some plot settings that you should take care to get right (such as bin size).

The possibilities for plotting data useing <tt>Seaborn</tt> are actually much more extensive than what we reviewed here.

You can see some examples in the official <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html"><tt>Seaborn</tt> gallery</a> - of you click on the plots in the gallery you get a little tutorial of how they made the plot. When you get more confident with Python you might return to this.

## More options

As the possibilities for customising plots are so extensive, no tutorial could cover all of them. Ultimately you will probably end up googling things like "how to put the rugplot outside the axis of a scatter plot in seaborn" - and will find many many tutorials to help you.

## More tutorials

There are many nice intros to plotting with <tt>Seaborn</tt> on the web.

Here are a couple that cover similar material to this chapter, if you would like to consolidate your learning with more examples:

A <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial">Pokemon-based tutorial</a> from Elite Data Science

A more <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-seaborn-tutorial/">programming-oriented one</a> from Geeks-for-Geeks

## Datacamp

There are free datacamp modules on <tt>Matplotlib</tt> and <tt>Seaborn</tt>
