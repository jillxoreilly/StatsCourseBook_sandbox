# Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

This week we are looking at relationships between two variables
measured in a bivariate (or multivariate) dataset.

After this week you should be able to:

<ul>
<li> Recognise and understand the equations for covariance and correlation 
<li> Explain conceptually the difference between covariance and
correlation (whereby correlation is a normalized form of covariance)
<li> Explain what would happen to correlation and covariance if the
units of the variables x or y or both are changed
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Recognise datasets with features that violate the assumptions for Pearson's
correlation:
<ol>
<li> non-linear relationship
<li> outliers
<li> heteroscedasticity
</ol>
<li> Explain why a rank-based correlation methon (Spearman's
correlation) resolves the issue in each case
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Visually identify interactions and crossover interactions in bar
plots of categorical data
</ul>

This material is covered in the lecture (also in the lecture videos on Canvas)

## Python skills

We are working with <tt>Pandas</tt> dataframes and some of the associated methods

After this week you should be able to:

<ul>
<li> Calculate the covariance matrix for a dataframe and understand what
each entry in the matrix means
<li> Calculate the correlation matrix for a dataframe and identify the
correlation value for a given pair of variables
<li> Obtain a correlation matrix for just the relevant columns, by
creating a reduced size dataframe
<li> Change the correlation method between Pearson and Spearman's
correlation
</ul>

This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section
