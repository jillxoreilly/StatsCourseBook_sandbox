# ### Toy example
# 
# Let's explore the idea of sampling with and without replacement using a very simple example (a simple example designed just to illustrate a point is sometimes called a <i>toy example</i>)
# 
# Say I have a dataset listing four children's pets:
# 
# [cat, dog, cat, rabbit]
# 
# If I sample from this dataset, I get a new list of pets. Say I draw a sample of size $ùëõ=2$, my sample might be [cat, cat] (if I'm lucky- I love cats!)
# 
# 
# #### Without replacement
# 
# If I sample without replacement, after I have 'drawn' my first sample pet fromt the original dataset, I cannot draw it again - my next sample pet will be drawn from the remaining three. The consequence of this is that all samples of size ùëõ=4 contain all of the original 4 pets, albeit in a different order
# 
# [cat, cat, dog, rabbit]
# 
# [rabbit, cat, dog, cat]
# 
# [cat, dog, rabbit, cat]
# 
# etc
# 
# #### With replacement
# 
# If I sample with replacement, each 'draw' can be any of the four animals (think of it like pulling a card from a deck, checking which animal is on it, and then replacing the card in the deck before the next sample is drawn).
# 
# So I could get:
# 
# [cat, cat, cat, cat]
# 
# if I'm really lucky!
# 
# or more likely:
# 
# [cat, dog, cat, cat]
# 
# [rabbit, dog, cat, rabbit]
# 
# ... etc
# 
# Let's try it, replacing the animals with numbers: dog = 1, cat = 2, rabbit = 3

# In[2]:


# Sampling without replacement
data = [2,1,3,2]
nReps= 10

for i in range(nReps):
    sample = np.random.choice(data,4,replace=False)
    print('sample ' + str(i) + ' = ' + str(sample))


# When sampling without replacement each sample should be identical in contents (albeit in a random order) - this is clearer if I sort the sample values in ascending order:

# In[3]:


# Sampling without replacement
data = [2,1,3,2]
nReps= 10

for i in range(nReps):
    sample = np.random.choice(data,4,replace=False)
    print('sample ' + str(i) + ' = ' + str(np.sort(sample)))


# <ul>
#     <li>Can you change the code above to sample <i>with</i> replacement?
#     <li>In your samples drawn with replacement, look for those which are not simply permutations of the original four datapoints (animals) but contain more or fewer cats/dogs/rabbits than expected
# </ul>

# ### Real world examples
# 
# A real world example of sampling without replacement would be if we give 100 students a wellbeing questionairre - each student in our sample is a member of the parent distribution (all students/ allstudents in the college we were sampling from etc). We will only want to survey each student once.
# 
# A real world of example of sampling with replacement is rolling a dice. Each diceroll yeilds an outcome (1-6) that is a sample from an infinite selection of possible outcomes (think of it as drawing a card from a deck of cards with numbers 1-6 on them, but because there are an infinite number of cards, 'using up' a six doesn't reduce the change of the next diceroll being a six).

# ## Sampling from a <tt>Pandas</tt> dataframe
# 
# In the example above our 'pets' were a <tt>numpy</tt> array, but more often our data are supplied as a dataframe (a table containing columns with text and numbers, with headings etc)
# 
# <tt>Pandas</tt> has a handy built-in sampling function which does a similar job to <tt>numpy.random.choice()</tt> but for sampling within a <tt>Pandas</tt> dataframe
# 
# Let's see it at work:

# In[4]:


pets = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jillxoreilly/StatsCourseBook/main/data/pets.csv')
pets


# In[5]:


# draw a sample of size n=3 without replacement
pets.sample(3, replace=False)


# In[6]:


# draw a sample of size n=8 with replacement
pets.sample(8, replace=True)


# In[7]:


# just get the column 'Pet'
pets.sample(8, replace=True)['Pet']


# In[8]:


# count the cats!
sum(pets.sample(8, replace=True)['Pet']=='cat')
