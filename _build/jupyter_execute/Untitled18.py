# Assessing Regression models in Python.

The process of applying equations for $R^2$, standard errors, and the 95% confidence intervals around the slope are all done for us in Python. In fact, without asking, Python gives us these statistics in the regression output. To have a first look, we will come back to the immigration attitudes data from last weekâ€™s tutorial.
