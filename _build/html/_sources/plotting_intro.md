# Plotting Data

This week we are thinking about how to plot data in order to
illustrate their key features -
<ul>
<li> What is the shape of the data distribution?
<li> How does the data distribution differ between data categories (eg
men/women, cars/towing/trucks, months of the year)
<li> What is the relationship between values in paired data (are they
correlated, is there a systematic difference within pairs such as
brothers taller than their sisters)
</ul>

We will learn to produce plots with Python, using the packages <tt>matplotlib</tt>
and <tt>seaborn</tt>

We will also think about how to make good choices when plotting data -
choosing an appropriate type of plot and appropriate scaling,
labeblling and settings

## Tasks for this week

<b>Conceptual material</b> is covered in the lecture. In addition to the
live lecture, you can find lecture videos on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything
<i>except</i> the page labelled "Tutorial Exercises") in advance of
the computer-based tutorial session.

To complete the guided exercises you will need to either:
<ul>
<li>open the pages in Google Colab (simply click the Colab button on each page), or
<li>download them as Jupyter Notbooks to your own computer and work
with them locally (eg in Spyder)
</ul>

If you find something difficult or have questions, you can discuss
with your tutor in the computer-based tutoral session.
