# Correlation and Covariance

This week we cover correlation and covariance

In the tutorial we will also review topics from Describing Data and
Plotting Data in preparation for the first hand-in exercise

## Tasks for this week

<b>Conceptual material</b> is covered in the lecture. In addition to the
live lecture, you can find lecture videos on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything
<i>except</i> the page labelled "Tutorial Exercises") in advance of
the computer-based tutorial session.

To complete the guided exercises you will need to either:
<ul>
<li>open the pages in Google Colab (simply click the Colab button on each page), or
<li>download them as Jupyter Notbooks to your own computer and work
with them locally (eg in Spyder)
</ul>

If you find something difficult or have questions, you can discuss
with your tutor in the computer-based tutoral session.
