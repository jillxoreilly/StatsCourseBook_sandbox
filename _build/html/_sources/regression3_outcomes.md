#  Learning Objectives

Conceptual

This week we have introduced multivariate analysis. After this week, you should be able to:

* Understand the equation and interpretation of R-squared.
* Understand the equation and how to interpret the significance test on the slope.
* Understand the standard error, t-statistic, and significance level in the regression table.
* Assess whether regression assumptions have been met.

These points will be covered in the lecture.

Python Skills

We will be working with `statsmodels` in Python again. This week, you will learn to:

*	Explore model assumptions including outliers and heteroskedasticity.
*	Use p-value and significance levels on intercept and slope. 
*	Plot a regression line with 95% confidence intervals.
*	Plot a ‘coefplot’ with error bars
