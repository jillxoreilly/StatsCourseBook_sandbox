#  Concepts: Statistical Significance in Regression

* What is statistical inference?

Inference is drawing conclusions about the population from sample data.

To be able to draw conclusions about the population from the results of a regression model, we need to check two things. First, whether the slope is statistically significantly different to zero, and second, whether the regression assumptions have been met. Weâ€™ll start by thinking about testing the slope for significance.

When we test a regression slope for significance, we are running a hypothesis test. We can set up the hypotheses in the following way, where $\Beta$ is the slope for $x$ in the population.

The null hypothesis can be written as $\mathcal{H_0}: \Beta = 0 $
And the alternative hypothesis as  $\mathcal{H_a}: \Beta \neq 0 $

Note: In regression we use the two-tailed test, as we are interested in testing whether there is **an association** and not to predict the direction of the association.
