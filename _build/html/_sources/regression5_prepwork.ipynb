    "\n",
    "* For age, the odds ratio tells us that for each additional year the odds of answering ‘true’ are 0.02 (or 2%) lower (using 1-0.98 for the effect size). (Here I will not interpret ‘colsci’ as it is not statistically significant. \n",

The likelihood-ratio test, (in python the LLR $p$-value) produces a $p$-value so that we can tell if our model is statistically significant. Low p-values (below 0.05) tell us that the model with the $x$s is significantly better at predicting the outcome than the baseline model. "
