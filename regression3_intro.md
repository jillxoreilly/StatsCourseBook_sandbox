# Regression Statistics

This week we get into some of the statistics associated with regression analysis. These are the ones that tell us how well our model fits the data.

## Tasks for this week

Conceptual material is covered in the lecture. In addition to the live lecture, you can find the lecture recording and additional materials on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything except the page labelled “Tutorial Exercises”) in advance of the computer-based tutorial session.
